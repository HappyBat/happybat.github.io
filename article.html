                <p>In the United Kingdom AD(H)D affects about 3-5% of children and 2% of adults. That means in a class
                    of 20 to 35
                    kids,
                    chances are at least one of them has AD(H)D. Can you think of 50 adult relatives, friends,
                    colleagues or
                    acquaintances?
                    Chances are, at least one of them will have AD(H)D, too. Chances also are, they do not know they
                    have it.
                    Experts
                    estimate that three quarters of all adults with AD(H)D are undiagnosed. They might struggle in life,
                    not knowing
                    they
                    could seek for help and effective treatment. In fact, people with AD(H)D are over seven times more
                    likely to
                    attempt
                    suicide and ten times more likely to complete it.</p>
                <p>But what does it mean for adults to have AD(H)D? Let us imagine a few hypothetic but probable
                    scenarios.
                    Picture the following situation:</p>

                <p class = "text-center"><i>Your employee and co-worker Brian has stayed at the office overnight for three days in
                        a row.
                        He hardly ate
                        anything and
                        is not seen by anyone unless they enter his office. In fact, he does not even change
                        his
                        posture. He seems
                        to be so deep
                        into his new project that even the deafening noise of the building site leaves him
                        undisturbed. If spoken
                        to, he barely
                        reacts nor remembers any conversation attempt there might have been. When on the
                        fourth day
                        he stands at
                        your door with
                        a spacey look and bloodshot eyes, the project, which was scheduled to be completed
                        in two
                        months, is
                        finished...</i></p>
                

                <p>Brian has Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (AD(H)D).</p>
                <p>You would not have thought so? No wonder, the term of this disability is heavily misleading.
                    Individuals with
                    AD(H)D do
                    not lack attention, they struggle in regulating it. Hans Biegert, school director of a very
                    successful private
                    school in
                    Germany that has a special teaching approach for pupils with AD(H)D, explains it like this:
                    “AD(H)D is, in its essence, a self-regulatory disorder. It is not concentration but impulse and
                    attention
                    regulation
                    that are disrupted. Positive feedback can help sustaining attention. That is why children with
                    AD(H)D can focus
                    on their
                    Gameboy, PlayStation and Nintendo for hours on end – they constantly generate feedback.”
                    So how about Brian? Does this explain his behaviour?</p>
                No. What Brian is experiencing is a phenomenon that has been frequently observed in individuals with
                AD(H)D,
                especially
                <p>those with more severe symptoms. It is colloquially termed as ‘hyperfocus’. Hyperfocus means to be so
                    intensely
                    focused
                    on something, that one is no longer aware of the outer world or even personal physical needs. This
                    can lead to
                    heightened productiveness, but it can also lead to the neglection of crucial tasks, appointments or
                    meetings.
                    Hyperfocus
                    has been subject of research, despite it not being listed among the diagnostic criteria for AD(H)D.
                    School director Biegert describes one case where one of his pupils, who can barely sit still, joined
                    the fishing
                    club
                    and sits at the river bank for hours.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, people with AD(H)D do not naturally have control over their hyperfocus, as they do not
                    have
                    control over
                    their attention in general. That is why someone with AD(H)D might start a project overly
                    enthusiastically
                    (hyperfocused)
                    but lose interest in it quite soon. It does not help to tell someone with AD(H)D “but you could
                    focus on xy for
                    days so
                    you can as well just focus now”. People with attention regulation problems cannot ‘just focus’, just
                    like
                    someone with
                    one leg cannot ‘just walk’.</p>
                <p>You, as Brian’s boss, might feel quite ambivalent towards him: He has periods of extreme productivity
                    and he
                    helps the
                    company advance with his flow of ideas and creativity. But he also rushes into the office ten
                    minutes late every
                    day, he
                    procrastinates projects dangerously long and is unable to prioritise tasks. He forgets deadlines and
                    makes
                    careless
                    mistakes in many projects. At one point, the survival of the company was at stake because he had
                    sent an email
                    containing a corporate secret to the wrong recipient. Should you fire him?</p>
                <p>For many people with AD(H)D there is no way they can concentrate on mundane and mechanical tasks
                    unless they take
                    medication. It prevents them from managing their lives and paying bills, but it also interferes with
                    professional life,
                    as they rarely get accommodations in the workplace. Individuals with AD(H)D also have distorted
                    perceptions of
                    time,
                    also called time blindness, that leads to difficulties in time estimation. They also have slower
                    processing
                    speed: the
                    speed in which a person can understand and react to the information they receive.</p>
                <p>All this leads to troubles at work and frequent job changes but also to problems in social
                    relationships. This is
                    usually sobering for both parties involved, as one feels unappreciated and neglected and the other
                    gets
                    increasingly
                    desperate with their unsuccessful attempts to change their behaviour. add the special something</p>
                <p>It does not come as a surprise that "those with ADHD receive 20,000 more negative messages by age 12
                    than those
                    without
                    the condition”, according to the AD(H)D expert Dr. Ned Hallowell. “They view themselves as
                    fundamentally
                    different and
                    flawed." There are not many accommodations for someone with AD(H)D in the workplace either. “Autism
                    is quite
                    popular in
                    a way” Cardiff researcher Syed points out, “there are accommodations for it and people understand
                    the issues to
                    a
                    certain degree. AD(H)D, however, is like the poor cousin of autism.” TRUDY The media, Trudy says,
                    does “no
                    longer
                    repeatedly post articles discrediting the existence of conditions such as dyslexia or autism, they
                    need to treat
                    ADHD
                    with the same level of acceptance.”</p>

                Now imagine the following situation:
                <p><i>You meet your friend Heather and her son Jonathan at the school yard. Heather tells you that your
                        daughter is
                        the only
                        friend who invited him to a birthday party. One of the teachers interrupts you just then, saying
                        that
                        Jonathan was
                        disturbing class and did not do his homework for the last three days. Suddenly, you hear your
                        child
                        screaming. Jonathan
                        is holding her toy, looking baffled. You begin to wonder, whether Heather has it all under
                        control and if
                        she is
                        providing any structure and guidance at all for her son. Maybe she just places him in front of
                        the TV all
                        day long?</i></p>
                <p>Who could have AD(H)D? Both, Heather and Jonathan.
                And that is what makes it so hard for Heather. Let us assume Heather and her son are undiagnosed.
                Heather is setting
                schedules, alarms and reminders everywhere, for both her son and herself. She takes her son out all day
                so that he
                can
                get rid of his surplus energy. And yet it is not enough. His talkativity and impulsivity leads to
                problems with
                peers
                despite her efforts to teach adequate social behaviour. Jonathan can never concentrate on his homework
                for more than
                fifteen minutes. She suspects AD(H)D but is afraid of getting him diagnosed because of all the stigma
                associated
                with
                it. People will just think it is bad parenting.
                Sadly, Heather’s situation is not that uncommon. Bad parenting or unfortunate environmental conditions
                are still
                wrongly
                perceived as causes for AD(H)D.
                “A big myth is that people just do not think it [AD(H)D] is real, despite all the scientific evidence.
                People say it
                is
                just made up and an excuse for naughty children” says Sharifah Syed, AD(H)D researcher and psychologist
                at Cardiff
                University.
                She explains such stigma is a reason why it takes parents a while to accept their children have AD(H)D.
                What many people do not know is that AD(H)D is highly heritable. The heritability is around 80 percent,
                which means
                that
                it runs in many families. In fact, you could say it is as heritable as intelligence. ‘Oh, that’s good
                news’, you may
                think, so we just allocate the AD(H)D gene?
                Sadly not. “Several genes could be identified”, says Professor Klaus-Peter Lesch, who is a highly
                reputed scientist
                in
                the area of neurobiology, “that can indicate AD(H)D and even the conditions that can occur together with
                it”.
                However,
                these genes are different ones for everyone. Only within a few all-AD(H)D families a certain gene could
                be found. A
                general single identifier like ‘the AD(H)D gene’, however, is non-existent.
                As the heritability of AD(H)D is not well known in the public and the disorder is still seen as an
                excuse by many
                people, individuals like our mum Heather struggle to refute the stigma. That does not make the struggle
                less real.
                “Just spending and hour or two for the assessment with an AD(H)D child can be so exhausting.” Says
                Cardiff
                researcher
                Syed sympathetically. As she describes it, in order to manage and live with a child with AD(H)D 24/7
                “you have to be
                almost like a super mum”.
                Professor Lesch from Germany, father of four children with AD(H)D agrees with her in that. It is
                especially
                difficult if
                one parent has the disorder themselves. He explains that mothers with AD(H)D have a low tolerance level
                and children
                with AD(H)D tend to have the baby colic, often due to allergies, with makes it difficult for the mothers
                to
                breastfeed
                them enough. According to current research, there are more and more indications that a lack of
                breastfeeding can
                lead to
                problems in brain development. Often, Lesch resumes, families break apart because of all the
                difficulties.
                If this was not hard enough, one must not forget about the stigma. A recent study concluded that the
                overwhelming
                majority of adults with AD(H)D had doubts about the validity of AD(H)D as a mental disorder. They
                perceived public
                stigma and discrimination, which caused them to suffer more psychological distress, self-esteem issues,
                functional
                impairment and decreased quality of life. In general, it made their ‘burden of disease’ much heavier.
                “The attitude towards AD(H)D is still not very good and a lot of stigma is attached to it in the media.”
                says
                researcher
                Syed. People with AD(H)D often get to hear phrases like “Oh, I also get distracted sometimes” or “ Yeah,
                I’m like
                that,
                always forgetting things…”, which can feel quite belittling for someone who is seriously affected by
                these
                dispositions.
                “All of us have some of it to some degree but for someone with AD(H)D it is like that ALL the time,
                24/7. It causes
                disruptions in their everyday life, from impeding them to focus, to hindering them to manage their
                relationships and
                their money.” says Syed. That is the difference.
                Now, imagine our final example:</p>
                <p><i>You are Lucy, a 12-year-old girl. Teachers get mad at you for daydreaming in lectures and missing
                        nearly
                        everything
                        during the classes. Somehow though, you manage to keep up and do well in school. However, doing
                        homework
                        takes you all
                        day. You are quiet and introvert and often afraid of other people, which might be due to your
                        low
                        self-esteem. Still,
                        you have a few good friends and are generally liked by classmates.
                        Eight years later, you find yourself at university. Suddenly, you are required to organise
                        yourself. No one
                        checks the
                        homework, gives you constant feedback or does the laundry for you. Your room gets messy, no
                        matter how hard
                        you try to
                        prevent it. You are too ashamed to allow people for visit. Often you are so late for lectures,
                        that you
                        decide not to go
                        at all. If you manage to, you cannot ignore all the noise around you. Your brain shuts down. You
                        forget
                        appointments.
                        You work several nights in a row before every deadline, given you realised there was a deadline.
                        Your grades
                        drop. You
                        know you are far away from reaching up to your potential. One day, you cannot stand up from bed
                        anymore. And
                        the next
                        day. And the next. After two weeks you go the doctor, asking to get diagnosed for
                        depression.</i></p>
                <p>“Adults with AD(H)D seldomly come to see a doctor or psychiatrist because of their core symptoms, but
                they come for
                disorders like substance abuse, depression or anxiety disorders, that derived from the AD(H)D in the
                first place”
                says
                Professor Lesch. “That is shutting the stable door after the horse has already bolted.” In fact, the
                discovery that
                many
                patients on the substance abuse station actually had AD(H)D as the primary condition, led Professor
                Lesch to
                research on
                the disorder.
                “AD(H)D is clearly undiagnosed, especially in girls and women” says Lesch. They often internalise
                symptoms and are
                good
                at fitting into the social expectations. Moreover, they tend to not show hyperactive symptoms (they have
                ADD instead
                of
                ADHD). There would be at least twice as many patients with AD(H)D if everyone were diagnosed, he says.
                TRUDY “The
                view
                of ADHD is predominantly male and negative.” “I did not get diagnosed when I needed it, because I was,
                according to
                my
                GP ‘too academic, too bright and not disruptive enough.”
                The main problems in adults, Lesch says, is that they never reach their potential and there is a huge
                discrepancy
                between what they could and expect themselves to achieve and what they are actually achieve.
                Now imagine yourself, undiagnosed Lucy, in the same situation but under Corona virus conditions. The
                last bit of
                your
                structure, your routines: gone. No social interaction, only remote learning. TRUDY
                At first, it might not seem straightforward that people with AD(H)D should suffer disproportionally more
                from the
                COVID-19 pandemic than neurotypicals. COVID-19 has led to an increase in many mental health conditions
                across the
                globe.
                Anxiety, depression and sleeping disorders among other conditions, are soaring due to this pandemic.
                Now fate would have it so, that these conditions are naturally all very prevalent among people with
                AD(H)D. One
                study
                conducted in China comes to the result that “during the COVID-19 outbreak, children’s ADHD behaviours
                significantly
                worsened in comparison to their normal state.” They ascribe it to the “loss of daily routine and the
                lack of
                interpersonal and social interaction.”
                While for most countries there is no information on the availability of health services during the
                pandemic, in
                Ireland
                it had, as a study suggests, a “significant impact on the provision of mental health services for
                children and
                adolescents with ADHD.”
                To sum up, people with AD(H)D are highly impacted by these restrictions and might have big difficulties
                accessing
                help.

                So, what did we learn from Brian, Heather, Jonathan and Lucy?
                AD(H)D is a highly heritable attention regulation impediment that can be a quite debilitating factor in
                people’s
                lives.
                Most of the time, it remains unseen. It rarely occurs alone but together with other disorders and there
                is a lot of
                stigma attached to it.
                Is it all bad though? No, only people do not know that!
                “The understanding and empathy for AD(H)D in the population is very limited, but so is the knowledge
                regarding the
                positive resources of it: creativity, the ability to think “outside of the box” and enthusiasm” says
                Professor
                Lesch.
                “If I ask you to name me 10 successful entrepreneurs” says Biegert “the majority of those probably have
                AD(H)D”.
                “They overcome boundaries and create new opportunities. They have the courage to try things others would
                shy away
                from.”
                “It is important not to disqualify it as weakness of character” says Lesch. Also, there is effective
                therapy and
                treatment. School director Biegert, on the other hand, stresses the importance of positive feedback, as
                it is
                something,
                people with AD(H)D rarely get to hear.
                For the future, researcher Syed wishes for more support for people with AD(H)D: “For adults it is
                especially
                stigmatising to go to the psychiatrist and seek help. If there was more support, people will be more
                likely to seek
                help.”
